# About this project

This is a personal project I was working on that allowed users to create books that they could publish online for others to read. It includes a front end, back end, and database. There were a bunch of other versions of this project which I do not currently have listed as public, because I kept restarting, but the code is well structured and I am proud of how streamlined everything is.

# Technology used
This project uses Node.js, express, React, MongoDB and more.
